It's important that the design system reflects components already in use, and that it is updated every time components come into use, or are refined.

## Refine a component

If you're using a component and find a feature that's missing, or doesn't work quite the way you expect, a good place to start is GitHub. Every component page links to a GitHub issue to discuss that component. Start in that issue, and add a comment about what's missing. 

If changes are agreed, create a Pull Request in GitHub to share the changes to the guidelines, and add an example of the refinement, if necessary.

## Propose a new component

If you need a component which you think is missing, start by [creating a GitHub issue](https://github.com/apluslms/a-plus-design-system/issues/new/choose), prefixed with "Component proposal: ". Give details about your use case.

After some discussion, if a new component is agreed, create a component with a "Beta" label, and add guidelines and examples.

It might make sense to only add components which will be usable multiple times.
