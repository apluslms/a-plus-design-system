title: A+ Design System
description: Consistent, robust and accessible components and styles for building in the A+ ecosystem.
---

To create a consistent, understandable and enjoyable-to-use experience for 
teachers and students using [the A+ ecosystem](https://apluslms.github.io), this design system includes simple components and guidelines on how to use them.

Follow the guidelines, to make the experience consistent and seamless. 

A consistent experience removes distractions, and allows students to focus on what they're learning, and teachers to focus on what they're teaching, without any extra friction.
